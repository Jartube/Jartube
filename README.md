My goals : ❤️🫶🌟

I am a dreamer and that is why I dream of having a nice family and starting my own business but I feel that my English is not the best, and that is why I strive to improve it every day.



My hobbies  ⚽️📸🏀

I love sports especially soccer, basketball, and skateboarding, I also like to draw, paint, sometimes video games attract me but they are not my favorite, apart from that I like to read and listen to podcasts about interesting topics of life, society, and different cultures.
